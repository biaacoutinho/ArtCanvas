## Project Description

The Graphic Editor project, developed in C# with Windows Forms, offers users a versatile platform for artistic expression. Providing a clean canvas as a creative playground, users can unleash their imagination by crafting shapes, including circles, rectangles, lines, points, and polylines. The editor boasts an intuitive interface that allows users to dynamically change the drawing color, fostering a rich and customizable artistic experience. To enhance user workflow, all drawings are intelligently stored in a linked list, offering efficient management and retrieval. Moreover, the editor empowers users to preserve their creations by enabling seamless saving of drawing information to a file at their convenience.
